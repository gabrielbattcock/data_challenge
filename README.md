# Data_Challenge

## Overview

## How to use this script

### 1. Download

If you have SSH configured, great, just `cd ~/YOUR/PATH` and run 
`git clone git@github.com:gabrielbattcock/data_challenge.git`
in your terminal and it'll be sorted.

If you don't, all is not lost my friend, you still need to `cd ~/YOUR/PATH` and run 
`git clone https://github.com/gabrielbattcock/data_challenge.git`
in your terminal.

### 2. Dependencies

This project cannot be built without the numerous packages from the R community. We use `pacman::p_load()` to install if needed, and load these packages without user intervention. If you prefer to install these selectively or individually, below is a comprehensive list of the packages, grouped by purpose.

### 3. Running the codes

**You don't need to run `source_data_entry.R` by itself. Open the script you need and it already includes a `source()` in the first few lines.**

With in the directory `../R_scripts`, there is a script called `source_data_entry.R` which gathers the various files in `../allData` that we have collected and outputs data frames which are used throughout the rest of the project. 

The remainder of the code are saved under folders named by their purpose. Refer to `../R_scripts/Season_data` for plots and analysis comparing each source over a season or in `../R_scripts/source`, which compares the seasons for a given source, such as GP data.
