# Introduction



### Background rationale

- Highly infectious and rapidly evolving respiratory virus circulating seasonally around the world
- Antigenic shifts may result in uncontrolled extensive spread causing an epidemic (e.g. 1918-2009)
- Progression may lead to deaths in at risk groups (children  <2 y.o., pregnant women, people >65 y.o. and people with underlying medical conditions)
- Seasonal influenza circulation puts a burden on NHS e.g. emergency room and GP services
- Vaccination averts between 180,000 and 626,000 cases of influenza per year in England
- Flu vaccination helps avert between 5,678 and 8,800 premature deaths per year
- The NHS flu vaccination programme costs Â£50,610 per death averted
- Understanding the circulation patterns can help UKHSA:
  - effectively allocate resources
  - forecast future season dynamics
  - aid early detection of anomalous seasons



### Research question

> *What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/3 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?*
