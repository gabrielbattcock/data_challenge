## Our Question

What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/3 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?

### Hypothesis

-   There is a temporal relationship between one source of surveillance and another.
-   There is also a relationship between the scale of the peaks between sources of influenza data.
-   There are changes in reporting patterns for Influenza-Like-Illnesses (ILI) post COVID

::: notes
We defined our Qs to address these issues. \\Szymon Hypothesis - There could be a time delay betw one source of surveillance and another. And the scale of the one that peaks earlier might be predictive of the later ones. \\Jack There are changes in reporting procedures for resp infections post-covid.

# Methods

## Data Sources

![infographic for data sources](images/fig-data-source.png)

![infographic for data sources](images/fig-data-source.png)

::: notes
-   **Primary care**: Royal College of GP appointments for Influence Like Illnesses
-   **Secondary care**: Hospitalisation data as reported by th UKHSA Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch system and the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance Schemes (USISS) prior to that.
-   **Laboratory confirmed**: Reports of respiratory infections made to PHE from PHE and NHS laboratories in England and Wales
:::

## Analysis

-   Time series plots
-   $R_0$ value for early spread
    -   $R = 1 +\dfrac{r}{b}$
-   Cross-correlation with Spearman's $\rho$

# Discussion


## Strengths and limitations

::: panel-tabset
### Strengths

-   Availability of multiple data sources
-   Statistical methodology
-   Stratification along age groups

### Limitations

-   Limited to publicly available data
-   Limited scope for statistical analysis
-   Lack of granularity of data
:::

## Our hypothesis revisited

::: panel-tabset

### Main

No observable:

-   Temporal relationship between data sources

-   Relationship between scale of peaks

-   Changes in reporting patterns post-COVID

### Secondary questions

When stratifying by age group:

-   Lag between 65+ and other age groups in post 2017-18 seasons

-   Case rate amongst \<15s can be used to infer rate amongst 65+s
:::

## Recommendations

-  Flu reports should be straitified by strain and age
-  Study the relationship between COVID-19 and influenza
-  Study influenza epidemics in a global context
