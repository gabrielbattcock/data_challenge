# Introduction

### Background rationale

- Infectious respiratory virus with seasonal circulation patterns
- Antigenic shifts may result in uncontrolled extensive spread causing an epidemic (e.g. 1918-2009)
- Progression may lead to deaths in at risk groups (children  <2 y.o., pregnant women, people >65 y.o. and people with underlying medical conditions)
- Annual fluctuation of influenza causes a burden to NHS e.g. emergency room and GP services
- Flu vaccine programme in the UK helps prevent between 5,678 and 8,800 premature deaths per year and between 180,000 and 626,000 instances of influenza in England each year
- The cost of the NHS flu vaccination programme is Â£50,610 for each life saved.
- Understanding the circulation patterns can help UKHSA:
  - effectively allocate resources
  - forecast future season dynamics
  - aid early detection of seasonal anomalies 
  
### Research question

> *What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/3 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?*
