## Introduction

Influenza is a highly infectious and rapidly evolving respiratory virus circulating seasonally around the world [@cope2018]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that between 290000-650000 deaths occur due to the respiratory virus, not including deaths not due to secondary infections caused by influenza [@WHO2022]. Antigenic shifts in the virus may result in uncontrolled extensive spread causing an epidemic (e.g. 1918-2009) [@cope2018]

Serious progression of the virus may lead to deaths in at risk groups such as children \<2 y.o., pregnant women, people \>65 y.o. and people with underlying medical conditions, [@zarocostas2009]. In a UK context, seasonal influenza circulation puts a burden on NHS especially hospital beds and GP services [@cope2018]. Having more data to help plan for seasonal peaks can help alleviate pressure on vital services.

### Who is UKHSA and why are they interested 

UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was created as a successor to Public Health England in April 2021 \[cite\]. Set up during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UKHSA's main priority is to tackle national health threats through the use of data analytics and developing vaccines \[cite\].

Understanding the data of how flu is spread can help assist in planning vaccination roll-out. Vaccination is greatly beneficial as it averts between 180,000 and 626,000 cases of influenza per year in England, helping prevent between 5,678 and 8,800 premature deaths [@franklin2018]. Furthermore, every death averted due to vaccination is estimated to save the NHS Â£50,610 [@franklin2018].

In the UK there are three main ways that influenza is reported: through primary care data, hospitalisation and through swabbing programmes. Having three separate data sources is a valuable so that
