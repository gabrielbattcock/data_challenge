## Abstract


Influenza is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus of the *Orthomyxoviridae* family. The virus ( has multiple species, with type A and type B being predominant in humans. Up to 650,000 deaths yearly can be directly attributed to seasonal outbreaks of influenza worldwide (*reference needed*)

Progression of influenza is usually self-limiting. For most, symptoms last for 2\~7 days. Severe cases might require hospitalisation, or can progress to death. This is a particular concern for at-risk groups, which include children \<2 years of age; pregnant women; the elderly \>65yo; and patients with comorbidities.

The UK's influenza surveillance system is multi-faceted. It includes sources like weekly % of GP consultations presenting with influenza-like illnesses (ILI), or death registrations where the leading cause is influenza. Our topic of interest has been defined with this diversity as a componenet:

> What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/23 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?

We hypothesise that there exists a temporal relationship between sources of surveillance. Statistical tools can then be applied to predict the timing and scale of a 'later' data source using an 'earlier' source. Additionally, different age groups can manifest at different time and scale, and one might be predictive of another. Additionally, we suspect changes in reporting procedures of respiratory infections post-covid may cause differences with pre-pandemic data

#### Data Processing


The data used in this project is publicly available on various governmental websites. Primary care data is published weekly by the RCGP Research and Surveillance Centre in the communicable and respiratory disease reports. Laboratory confirmed cases are reported weekly by UKHSA. Secondary care data is extracted from the UKHSA Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Watch (SARI Watch) system, updated weekly during the influenza season (week 40 - week 20 next year). Mortality data is reported weekly by the ONS. All cleaning and processing are done using the R language.


#### Analysis

At first glimpse, the peak for each data source does not differ much from each other in a given year.

Cross-correlation between two data sources can be measured using Spearman's $ρ$, a non-parametric test of correlation. To ascertain the pairwise time lag (if any), Spearman's test is run repeatedly with a gradually increasing lag. The lag value associated with the best $ρ$ is reported as the lag between given sources for a given year.

## Introduction

Influenza is a highly infectious and rapidly evolving respiratory virus circulating seasonally around the world [@cope2018]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that between 290000-650000 deaths occur due to the respiratory virus, not including deaths not due to secondary infections caused by influenza [@WHO2022]. Like most viruses, influenza is highly mutable. It can change on its own (*i.e.* antigenic drift), or cross with other strains (*i.e.* antigenic shift) [@CDC2022], possibly leading to uncontrolled extensive spreads causing an epidemic, such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [@cope2018].


The virus (family *Orthomyxoviridae*) has multiple species, with type A and type B being predominant in spreading among human [@CDC2022]. They can be further classified by the H (as in Hemagglutinin) and N (as in neuraminidase) antigen present on the virus. Each year, a combination of the A subtypes and B type influenza circulates throughout the population at different proportions. Some evidence to suggest that H3N2 subtype is more severe than H1N1, leading to higher hospitalisation rates \[cite\]


After an incubation period, usually 1\~3 days, the progression of the disease is self-limiting and symptoms might last 2\~7 days \[cite::green book\]. Serious progression of the virus may lead to deaths in at-risk groups such as children (\<2 y.o.), pregnant women, the elderly (\>65 y.o.) and people with underlying medical conditions [@zarocostas2009]. In a UK context, seasonal influenza circulation burdens the NHS in terms of availability of hospital beds and GP services [@cope2018]. Having more data to help plan for seasonal peaks can help alleviate pressure on vital services.

### Who is the UKHSA and why are they interested

The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) was created as a successor to Public Health England in April 2021. Set up during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UKHSA's main priority is to tackle national health threats. They are responsible for the surveillance of diseases including influenza and manage the country's vaccine programme. 

Through studying the temporal nature of the data reporting of influenza, the UKHSA can better plan for the height of the influenza season within hospitals and plan the vaccination roll out. Vaccination is greatly beneficial as it averts between 180,000 and 626,000 cases of influenza per year in England, helping prevent between 5,678 and 8,800 premature deaths [@franklin2018]. Furthermore, every death averted due to vaccination is estimated to save the NHS £50,610 [@franklin2018].

In the UK, influenza data is reported by three main sources: through primary care data, hospitalisation data and through swabbing programmes. Having three separate data sources is a valuable to compare whether the peak in the seasonal spread is in the same week or whether any of the data sources lag the others - identifying a possible prediction of a peak in hospitalisations for example. Throguh the studying the swabbing data, it will aslo be beneficial to know what relationship the strain of influenza has on hospitalisation rate. Knowing the temporal nature of which age groups are beign affected when may help hosopitals be better prepareed for an oncoming wave of influenza cases.

### Aims

We defined our main research question to address the issues described above.

*Question:* What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/23 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?

*Hypothesis:* We suspect that there is a time delay between one source of surveillance and another and the scale of the one that peaks earlier might be predictive of the later ones (GP consultations being greater than hospitalisations for example). Secondly we believe there could be changes in reporting procedures for respiratory infections post-COVID, such as an increase in swabbing. As children have more interactions in schools and nurseries, we would expect a larger peak for children before a peak in the older population. Finally, we expect the hospitalisation rate to change depending on which influenza strain is mainly in circulation during the season. 

## Methods

### Data sources and extraction

![The data being used comes from various places and has been sourced through difference resources.](images/fig-data-source.png){width="100%"}

Three main sources of influenza case data have been extracted from various places. Firstly, primary care data was reported by the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre communicable and respiratory disease reports. Cases of Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI) that present in participating GP practices  are collected and reported for England and Wales [@RCGP]. 

Secondary care data was extracted from the UKHSA Severe Acute Respiratory Infection Watch system. 

Mortality data is extracted from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) weekly bulletin of death registrations (England and Wales). The variable of interest is `Deaths due to influenza and pneumonia (ICD J09-J18)`, and from 2020 onwards, `Deaths involving to influenza and pneumonia (ICD J09-J18)`. These are defined by the occurrence of said phrase on either the first cause of death, or anywhere in the `cause of death` field.

### Data Processing


### Statistical Analysis

#### Cross-correlation

Spearman's non-parametric test of correlation (denoted $ρ$) is more suitable than Pearson's in this situation, since the latter requires all variable to be normally distributed. Spearman's $ρ$ uses the ranks to replace the actual values within each variable. It runs as long as the variables are equal in length. The measurement of cross-correlation between pairs of variables should be as follows. One variable, denoted $x_{t}$, is pinned to the present. A lag of positive integer $k$ is applied to the other variable $y$ to generate \$y\_{t},; y\_{t+1},; \ldots y\_{t+k} \$ . For a given influenza season, Spearman's test is run repeatedly between $x$ and each version of $y$. The lag that gives the best correlation, denoted $\arg\underset{k}\max \,\rho(x,y_{t+k})$, is reported for each year for each pair of variables.

#### Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)

MEM is widely used by disease control agencies (incl. PHE and UKHSA) to model epidemics and generate threshold levels from historical data. First, the epidemic period in a season is identified as the minimum number of consecutive weeks with the maximum accumulated rates percentage (MAP). The season can then be split into pre-epidemic, epidemic, and post-epidemic periods. Within each, a given number of data points will be sampled. The number of sample remains at 30 regardless of availability. Assuming these fit into a normal distribution, their geometric mean will have confidence intervals. The upper bounds of $\text{CI}_{50},\; \text{CI}_{90},\; \text{CI}_{95}$ act as the threshold values. Along with the cutoff for entering the epidemic period, these four values give us five bands: not-epidemic, baseline, and low, moderate, high, very high threat to the public. In this report, the plots for GP and hospitalisation use the values as-is from UKHSA publications for the respective seasons.

#### Reproduction Number $R_0$

Reproduction numbers can be used to calculate how much a disease will spread. It represents the number of new infections one positive case can reproduce. If $R_0$ is greater than 1, the disease is growing, while if it is below 1, the spread is slowing. While $R_0$ is used at the beginning of the spread of a new virus to a completely susceptible popultaion, an effective reproduction number can be calculated for a population that contains some immunity, such as for an influenza virus. This can be inferred from the observed exponential growth rate seen at the beginning of an influenza epidemic. The observed reproduction number $R$ can be found through the linear equation $R = 1 + \dfrac{r}{b}$ , where $r$ is the rate of exponential growth and $b$ is the rate of leaving the infectious stage [@lipsitch2003]. By approximating the beginning of the growth curves as $N=ke^{\frac{rt}{b}}$ (where $k$ is a constant), the value $\dfrac {r}{b}$ can be found from the gradient when plotting $\log (N)$ against $t$.

In practice, log graphs were plotted and a linear model was fitted to the points at the beginning of the epidemic. Using the gradient, the $R_{\text{eff}}$ was calculated for each data source, each season.

## Results

To see view the trends in the data and to first explore it, case rate per 100,000 people was plotted against epidemic week. Lines for each season have been represented on of the same plot, each for a different data source.

**Figure 5**: Lab-confirmed cases of influenza, stratified by influenza strain (A and B). Data reported from PHE/UKHSA lab confirmed cases of influenza.

In figures 3 and 4, we represent the Moving Epidemic Model thresholds against trends of primary and secondary care cases in the background.

We expected to see that over different seasons, peaks appear at different weeks. This is due to the complex dynamics of influenza spread which do not replicate every season. The magnitude of the peaks case rates however do indicate differing levels of severity in influenza between seasons.

This visualisation shows similarity in temporal characterisitcs between the 2017-18/2018-19 influenza seasons; and between the 2019-20/2022-23 influenza seasons. In primary care data, the peaks for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 influenza seasons occur at week 4 (with a subsequent peak in 2018-19 at week 7). We see a similar split in secondary care data. Secondary cases in 2017-18 peak at week 3, with a smaller peak across weeks 8-9. For 2018-19 the case rate peaks at week 7. In lab confirmed cases of influenza A, both 2017-18 and 2018-19 influenza seasons peak at week 7.

In the primary care data, the peaks for the 2019-20 and 2022-23 season occur in the previous year at 52 and 50 weeks respectively. In secondary care data and lab confirmed cases of influenza A, the peaks for seasons 2019-20 and 2022-23 occur in the previous year at week 52.

Lab confirmed cases of influenza A (Figure 5a) reinforce the backshift we see between the 2017-18/2018-19 seasons and the 2019-20/2022-23 seasons. The peak for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 season occur at week 7, similar to our finding s for secondary care and for reported primary care cases in the 2018-19 season. The peak case rate for both 2019-20 and 2022-23 seasons occur at week 52, in line with the secondary care cases for both seasons, and primary care data for 2022-23.

Lab confirmed cases of influenza B only appear to increase notable for the 2017-18 outbreak, with the cases for subsequent seasons not increasing to the same magnitude.

Its difficult to be confident in our post-covid analysis as the only data that we have available is the 2022-23 season, which at time of report writing is ongoing. The relationships observed on the brief analysis done amay not hold should the 2022-23 outbreak change in characteristic.

For each season, cases of ILI reported by primary care sources dominate secondary care and lab confirmed case reporting. For 2017-18, the peak for primary care cases reported by the RCGP was 54.1 cases per 100,000. This was the greatest extent of the influenza epidemic as reflected by primary care data. The subsequent 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons saw more modest peaks of 23.1 and 19.4 cases per 100,000 respectively. For the post-COVID influenza season, of data included at time of report writing, the current peak of primary care cases exists at 31.3 cases per 100,000. This is larger than the two pre-COVID influenza season data.

Secondary care and lab confirmed case rates mirror each other closely across pre-pandemic influenza seasons. The magnitude of impact between hospitalisation and lab-confirmed cases also appear to be similar in pre-pandemic data.

However, post-COVID, the peak for secondary care data reached 14.8 per 100,000 cases in week 12, whereas the maximum reported rate for lab confirmed cases reached 5.43 per 100,000 in the same week of data available. In pre-pandemic influenza seasons, the peaks for secondary care cases occured during weeks 15 (8.86 per 100,000 in 2017-18), 19 (6.87 per 100,000 in 2018-19) and 12 (7.50 per 100,000 in 2019-20). Lab confirmed cases peaked during weeks 17 (6.55 per 100,000 in 2017-18), 19 (6.19 per 100,000 in 2018-19) and 12 (6.64 per 100,000 in 2019-20). Its too early to determine whether this years influenza season pattern amongst secondary care and lab confirmed cases matches patterns of 2017-18 and 2018-19 or of 2019-20. -- Jack matrix on correlation --

To further investgate the temporal relationships between the data sources, effective reproduction numbers $R$ were  calculated to evaluate the difference in the rate of spread between data sources. The case rate per 100,000 was transformed using a natural logarithm and plotted against epidemiological week. The log plot resulted in a straight line during the initial exponential growth period and a tail after the peak of infections, as was expected from theory. The plots were evaluated to find which weeks to fit a linear model to. Using the linear model function in R, a line was overlaid on the log plots and coefficients of gradients for each of the lines were extracted. Using $R = 1 + \frac{r}{b}$, as detailed above, the $R$ was calculated.

The estimated $R$ for each year and data source is detailed below. As expected at the beginning of a flu season, the R numbers are all above 1. It is noted that a higher reproduction number calculated for the data from hospitalisations than from GP consultations.

Using data provided by the RCGP, influenza data has been plotted stratified by age. This has been reported as ILI rate per 100,000, and broken down in to three age groups: \\\<15 years, 15-64 years and 65+ years.

For the season 2017-18, there is a lag between the peaks of adults older than 15 years and children. The large growth of the epidemic this season begins at week 50 and peaks at week 3 for all ages except \\\<15 years which peak at week 5. This may be due to the timing of the epidemic overlapping with UK school holidays, leading children to having less social interaction, therefore delaying their peak by two weeks.

For the season 2018-19 there appears to be a minor peak followed by a larger peak a few weeks later. This year, the second peak among the 65+ age group lags behind all other age groups by a week. This may be due to less socialising among the older age group.

The season 2019-20 shows multiple peaks with the expected dip over the holiday period (between weeks 51-1). As with the 2018-19 season, the 65+ age group lag behind the other age groups, with the largest peak for this age group two weeks after all other ages. There is also an evident spike at week 12 for this year. As this data is recording "Influenza *like* illness", it can be assumed that this peak is due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current influenza season also shows a lag in growth among the 65+ group. The data however does not go up show where the peaks are, so we do not know the full picture. It is also shown that the under 15 years have a lower gradient after week 51 around the winter holidays begin. \### Stratified by influenza strain type

This figure (A) plots total recorded influenza cases by week in the influenza season (defined as the 40th week of the previous year to the 20th week of the subsequent), separated by strain of influenza for each included influenza season as recorded by Datamart scheme. Starting with the first studied season (2017-2018), it was clearly dominated by the type B influenza. The earliest rise in cases was observed in the A H3 subtype cases, starting around week 46, whilst the other strains present a delay of approximately one week. Moving forward in the season, week 49 brings increase in growth of the number of cases for type B and A H3 subtype. This was the key significant period for both A H3 subtype and B type, which went onto reach their peaks in week 2 and 3 respectively. Peak number of cases for A H3 subtype reached almost 350 and more than 600 cases for type B. Immediately after its peak, cases of type B influenza started decreasing gradually, with occasional increases in week 8, reaching 400 cases and in week 11 reaching approximately 250 cases. A similar trend was observed in the incidence of the A H3 subtype influenza which decreased in week 6 to 200 cases and fluctuated between 250-170 for the next six weeks. An important point is that the H1N1 type A starts to plateau around week 2 of 2018, reaching a point of approximately 50 cases daily, a threshold that was never surpassed again throughout the season. The unknown A type reaches its peak of 150 cases in week 6 to later fluctuate between 50-100 cases until week 15, when it gradually started to drop.

In the next figure (B) observed data covers the period from 2018 to 2019. For this particular season available data was strafed only by two types - A (unknown subtype) and B. During this season incidence of type B influenza reached a maximum of 11 cases in 45th week and did not pass the threshold of 10 after. Growth in incidence of type A influenza started at week 44 and continued, with a steeper rise starting in week 51 when over 300 new cases were recorded. This strain has dominated the season soaring at nearly 800 cases in week 3. After a slight dip during the next week, incidence of the unknown type A influenza peaked during week 7 with almost 1250 of new cases. It started plummeting until week 10 and gradually decreased until the end of the season.

During the season 2019 - 2020, cases of A H1N1, unknown type A and type B caused only minor burden in comparison to the A H3 subtype as seen in the figure C. All of the analysed strains apart from A H3 seem to be fluctuating around 10-30 cases between week 43 of 2019 and week 9 of 2020. Incidence of A H3 started to rise during the week 43 of the season and peaked in week 52. After its peak it has dropped rapidly to eventually level off during week 5 and fluctuate around the same incidence.

Post-pandemic season 2022 - 2023 is represented by figure D. We can observe that both type B influenza and the A H1N1 subtype represented only a fraction of all incidence, reaching approximately 50 cases each during 52nd week. The most dominant strain of the season was unknown type A influenza, which was on the rise since the first week of the season. During 50th week cases started soaring until incidence of the type A influenza reached its peak of almost 2300 new cases in week 52 of 2022. Second most dominant strain of the season - A H3 presented slower rise, starting in week 46 and peaking at 1250 new cases at the same time as type A - week 52. Data in the graph only represents incidence until week 5 of the year 2023 and that's when we can observe a decline in all of the cases.

## Discussion

### Log graphs and $R_0$ value

The reproduction number has been estimated for each of the seasons and each of the data sources. Through the use of a linear model, the gradient has been extracted to then be used to calculate the effective $R$ number. From the results calculated, it is clear that the estimate is larger for both hospitalisation data and swab data than for the GP data. 

The calculation here is a simplistic approximation for the reproduction number but does show that the spread of cases is slower for GP consultations which is more indicative of the general population as not everyone who goes to a GP for flu symptoms will be referred to hospital. This also gives some evidence towards a temporal relationship between GP consultations and hospitalisations, as knowing when there is a rise in the cases in GPs infers that there will be a large rise in hospitalisation following. 

As mentioned above, this calculation is not a complex model to estimate the reproduction number for influenza but does give a good estimate to be used in the report. Estimating the reproduction number for a virus such as influenza can be difficult due as it is uncertain the level of immunity among the population. 

While it may help throughout the report to have more granularity of data, it may not give a better estimate of the reproduction number. The results have assisted in showing a temporal relationship between GP cases and hospitalisations.
