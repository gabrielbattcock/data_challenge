## Introduction
### What are is influenza?

-   Influenza (flu) is a highly infectious and rapidly evolving respiratory virus circulating annually around the world
-   Antigenic shifts may result in uncontrolled extensive spread causing an epidemic (e.g. 1918-2009)
-   Progression (of ......) may lead to deaths in at risk groups (children \<2 y.o., pregnant women, people \>65 y.o. and people with underlying medical conditions)
-   Seasonal influenza circulation puts a burden on NHS e.g. emergency room and GP services
-   Vaccination averts between 180,000 and 626,000 cases of influenza per year in England
-   Flu vaccination helps avert between 5,678 and 8,800 premature deaths per year
-   The NHS flu vaccination programme costs Â£50,610 per death averted

### Why are we interested in studying the temporal nature of flu

-   Understanding the circulation patterns can help UKHSA:
    -   effectively allocate resources
    -   forecast future season dynamics
    -   to aid early detection of anomalous seasons

## Our Question

What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/3 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?

## Data Sources

::: incremental
-   **Primary care**: Royal College of GP appointments for Influence Like Illnesses
-   **Secondary care**: Hospitalisation data as reported by th UKHSA Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch system and the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance Schemes (USISS) prior to that.
-   **Laboratory confirmed**: Reports of respiratory infections made to PHE from PHE and NHS laboratories in England and Wales

# Methods

## Data aquisition 

- Various methods of converting data to a usable form have been used:
    - UKHSA provides OpenDocument spreadsheets (.ODS) for all collected flu data from 2022-23
    - PDF scraping (use of R script provided to us) - swabs
    -
