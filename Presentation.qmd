## Our Question

What is the temporal relationship between different influenza data sources (lab-confirmed infections, GP consultations, hospitalisations) in the UK, and have these changed in 2022/3 compared to the pre-pandemic years 2016-2019?

::: notes
We defined our Qs to address these issues. \\Szymon Hypothesis - There could be a time delay betw one source of surveillance and another. And the scale of the one that peaks earlier might be predictive of the later ones. \\Jack There are changes in reporting procedures for resp infections post-covid.

## Data Sources

![infographic for data sources](images/fig-data-source.png)

::: notes
-   **Primary care**: Royal College of GP appointments for Influence Like Illnesses
-   **Secondary care**: Hospitalisation data as reported by th UKHSA Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Watch system and the UK Severe Influenza Surveillance Schemes (USISS) prior to that.
-   **Laboratory confirmed**: Reports of respiratory infections made to PHE from PHE and NHS laboratories in England and Wales

# Methods



## Data aquisition

-   Various methods of converting data to a usable form have been used:
    -   UKHSA provided OpenDocument spreadsheets (.ODS) for all flu data (RCGP, USISS and SARI) from 2018-23
    -   PDF scraping (use of R script provided to us) - swabs
    -   2017-18 data for hospitalisation and GP consultations was manually entered from weekly published reports.

## Analysis

-   Time series plots
-   $R_0$ value for early spread
-   Calculate delay of peak/initial spread of flu between different data sources
